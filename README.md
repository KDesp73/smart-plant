The Smart-Plant project is an IoT-based solution designed to monitor and optimize plant care. Using sensors to track key environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light levels, the system provides real-time data and insights to help users maintain healthy plants. The project includes a web dashboard for live monitoring, statistics, and alerts, allowing users to adjust plant care settings like watering intervals and sunlight exposure based on specific plant needs. With automated notifications and continuous data updates, Smart-Plant ensures that your plants receive optimal care, even when you're away.
